# selenium_python_VA_VEC_chat_bot
Use this to automate getting connected to Virginia's unemployment agents so you don't have to manually do it all day

Things you'll need:
Python 2.7, 3.4+
Driver for browser ([Chrome](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads), [Firefox](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases))
Selenium package ([pypi](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/), [conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/selenium))

Just edit the chat.py script with your personal info and this and run it. This script will engage with the Virginia Unemployment Chat bot and repeatedly fill out the requisite information for you. It also mutes the chat audio and will play a Zelda "Du nu nu nahhhhhh!" once it has landed you in a queue with an Agent.
